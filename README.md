Purpose:
The purpose of the Capstone Project is to showcase skills learned throughout the course by defining, designing and delivering an end-to-end data science solution.

Project Summary:
1. Business Problem:
   * During growing season, apple orchards are subjected to constant threats from insects, fungal, bacterial, viral pathogens.
   * With an annual worth of $15 billion USD, the U.S apple industry could potentially inccur immense losses due to the abovementioned threats.
2. Data Science Problem:
   * A plant pathology expert does the ground work to resolve problems cause by infected saplings.
   * E.g. Identifying the pathogen(s) infecting the saplings to administer treatment.
3. Proposed solution:
   * Manually processing each sapling can be time consuming and labor intensive, therefore, machine learning can be utilized here to speed up this process.
4. Dataset:
   * [Kaggle competitions dataset - Plant pathology 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-pathology-2020-fgvc7/data)
5. EDA:
   * Refer to [IOD Capstone Project.pdf](IOD_Capstone_Project.pdf) slides 6-10 for exploratory data analysis.
6. Models and Evaluation:
   * Refer to [IOD Capstone Project.pdf](IOD_Capstone_Project.pdf) slides 11-14 for the models used as well as evaluation.
7. API:
   * An API was built and hosted locally to simulate the user (plant pathology expert) utilizing this tool for faster processing of plant pathogens.
   * Refer to [IOD Capstone Project.pdf](IOD_Capstone_Project.pdf) slide 15 for API demo.
8. Conclusion / Future Work
   * Refer to [IOD Capstone Project.pdf](IOD_Capstone_Project.pdf) slide 16.
